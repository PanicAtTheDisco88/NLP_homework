# NLP_homework

The purpose of this python program is to better understand the sentiment, language (i.e. words), and who is discussing BTC and ETH via the analysis of news articles. 

To do this, I have utilized several nltk libraries including nltk's vader sentiment analysis library. I have also utilized spacy to analyse "who" is talking about BTC and ETH. 

The data source for ths program is the free version of the newsapi. Newsapi limits article retreival to the first 200 words, and as such this program is limited in its analysis.
